In thousands of Swiss households, household helpers take care of the laundry, look after the children and ensure cleanliness. On average, they get around 30 francs per hour gross wage for their work. However, most of them receive 28 francs. After deducting the contributions for the obligatory accident insurance and social insurance, the household help still has an average of 25 francs per hour, as reported by the company Quitt.ch, which specializes in payroll accounting for household help. The analysis of more than 4000 employment contracts, which, according to Quitt.ch, is also used by the Federal Statistical Office, reveals significant wage differences depending on the canton. Cleaning staff receive the highest gross wages in the canton of Zurich at CHF 31.70 per hour.

Because Cardi's daughter Kulture (2) is so obsessed with the British cartoon character that she currently wants to jump into every puddle of rain like her big role model. In the probably not very serious tweet, Cardi even threatens the cartoon character: "Count your damn days!" The fact that Kulture now has a "Peppa Pig" ban cannot be ruled out, but it would be pretty nasty. Maybe Cardi Kulture shouldn't wear the most expensive Ugg boots anymore?

The Federal Council has estimated the R value for December 4th, which is an exponential growth. A week later, she corrected this down to 1.05 - and on December 28, the calculation of the R value for December 4 was exactly 1. The experts are convinced that the current R value does not reflect the real infection process and that the actual current number of reproductions is higher. The task force has repeatedly pointed out that with the currently extremely high number of cases, it would make sense to halve the number every two weeks. The task force therefore does not focus on daily R values, but takes into account the 7-day average together with other indicators when assessing the situation.

People over 65 were particularly affected by this excess mortality in the first and second corona waves (see graphic below).

However, current figures show that this has changed since the end of last year.
Reto M.*, a service engineer, lost his driver's license. He had to undergo surgery and wear a device that measures his heart activity for a year and a half. In the end, the procedure lasted 2.5 years and cost M.* more than 6,500 francs. Politically, the initiative seems undisputed: the Commission recommended it for acceptance without a dissenting vote, and the National Council and the Council of States also approved it. Caroni wants to speed up the procedure for a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license: According to the new regulation, M.* should have been informed within ten days whether a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license is ordered Or if he gets his driver's license back. M. could have contested this order in the first ten days and then every three months. Politically, the initiative seems undisputed: the Commission recommended it for acceptance without a dissenting vote, and the National Council and the Council of States also approved it. The Roadcross organization, on the other hand, has concerns: "We are definitely in favor of people who are affected by a driver's license withdrawal being given a fair process and having the opportunity to defend themselves," says media spokesman Mike Egle.

Australian filmmakers are relocating to the country. Marvel superheroes Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt are already filming in Australia. The Australian government has pumped the equivalent of around 290 million francs into its location incentive program, which is intended to attract international TV and film productions. For example, Melissa McCarthy and her husband, film producer Ben Falcone (47), received the equivalent of over nine million francs to shoot "God's Favorite Idiot" in Australia. But even outside of the Marvel Universe, numerous other major productions are currently relying on almost Covid-free Australia, which has enormous film sets to offer. Australian-born Isla Fisher (45) and Nicole Kidman (53), for example, returned to their homeland with their families for a long time after several years in the States during the pandemic. And the American Zac Efron (33) also made Australia his new home at the end of last year.

"Who we were" is a new documentary about how things are with our planet. It takes us to impressive locations, including the depths of the ocean, to the contaminated zone of Fukushima and into space. A film as a research trip, that's what drove Bauder: "We have information that didn't exist years ago. So how can I network this information and get people out of their passivity?" Six experts have their say, including marine biologist Sylvia Earle and astronaut Alexander Gerst. The documentary illuminates how sustainable, positive change works can and looks to the future: What will future societies think about us? The film was inspired by the eponymous book, which Roger Willemsen was still working on until shortly before his death in 2016.

The canton of St. Gallen is providing five million francs for financial support for people who are no longer able to cover their expenses due to the corona crisis and despite comprehensive federal and cantonal aid programs. Adela Civic, head of the family and social welfare department at the Social Affairs Office, says: "It is a targeted measure. These people should not get into a spiral of debt".

According to a study in Sydney, more and more cockatoos have learned how to open garbage cans. From a survey of residents, ornithologist Richard Major in Australia and researchers in Germany found that in early 2018, cockatoos in three neighborhoods of Sydney were good at opening bins with their beaks, then moving along the bin rim far enough to do so the trash can lid tilts backwards.

Markus S√∂der (CSU) has cancelled a trip to the North Sea. There he would have wanted to go on a mudflat hike with a colleague and would have gone to the seal banks, as German media reports unanimously. But nothing will come of the leisurely trip to the weekend. The Free State, headed by the CSU Prime Minister, is following a strict course in the fight against the corona virus. S√∂der had pushed the tests on the highways and at train stations And so the criticism of his person and the government was not long in coming. Ludwig Hartmann, the leader of the Greens in the state parliament, spoke of "blatant government failure" and FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen tweeted: "S√∂der's staging as a corona model student is increasingly getting cracks".

The Bern canton police also failed to give non-participants a deadline to leave the building.

The Polish workers at the waste incineration plant of the Basel Industrial Works (IWB) are being asked to cheat when recording working hours.

The bz cites oral sources and documents intended to show "how Swiss labor law is being undermined".

The cantonal police in Bern are again making negative headlines in connection with racism. Some Bernese police officers shared racist content, some Islamophobic, on Facebook and Twitter. According to the response from the Bern government council, the Kapo is aware of individual employees who made racist and right-wing extremist statements on social media. However, there can hardly be any talk of a mass problem - because the cantonal police in Bern employ around 2,500 police officers. It is now being demanded that racism be addressed more intensively by the police, including in the field of training. "Police officers should be encouraged to address and report wrongful acts and statements by their colleagues instead of covering up them," says Councilor Christa Ammann of the Alternative Left.
