Last week you did an Insta Q&A and asked "How are the guys?" relatively surprisingly answered with "I'm gay". Why did you decide to answer the question at all? I could have ignored this question, because about 300 came in. But many revolved around the topic of love and men. Even though I hardly ever post anything private on my channel, this time I thought: why not? Was that something like an outing? Not for me personally. My family and friends have known about it since 2016. Since then I've been walking around town with my (then) girlfriend, going to gay parties - I've never really been in the closet. Sexual orientation shouldn't be something you have to hide and then come out with anyway. After all, I've never heard of a hetero coming out.

If they encounter a Sars-CoV2 virus, there is a reaction with antigens of the virus. This makes the color particles visible. Politicians from the opposition party make fun of FP√ñ General Secretary Schnedlitz. Alexander Melchior from the ruling √ñVP turned to Schnedlitz immediately after the experiment had been carried out: "I had hoped all along that it wasn't Cola, but Bacardi-Cola.

As with conventional dates, however, the risk of embarrassing breaks and uncomfortable moments of silence cannot be ruled out. To prevent this from happening, Tinder teamed up with couples and relationship expert Matt Davies to put together 21 questions that can help Tinder users get to know their matches better or even fall in love.

The Federal Council estimated the R value on December 4th at 1.13, which is an exponential growth. A week later, she corrected this down to 1.05 - and on December 28, the calculation of the R value for December 4 was exactly 1. The experts are convinced that the current R value does not reflect the real infection process and that the actual current number of reproductions is higher. According to Tanja Stadler, the estimate of the R value only ever indicates a trend as to how the number of infections developed around two weeks ago. The task force therefore does not focus on daily R values, but takes into account the 7-day average together with other indicators when assessing the situation. According to Stadler, weekend effects and public holidays generally cause "noise" in the data. This must be smoothed out so that random fluctuations are not represented too strongly.

It is also a sign of disregard for the successful offspring.

According to Trump, the plan was actually for Pfizer to publish the data in October, i.e. before the election.

It probably would have affected the election if it had made Pfizer public earlier, Trump said.

Mike was a parasite and he stole from her. Serena is single and childless. Mike was sentenced to eleven years in prison and deported to Germany. In hindsight, it feels like an attempted elimination assassination. Mike was sentenced to eleven years in prison and deported to Germany. Almost two decades have passed since that fact.

After the court hearing, I found out that on the day of the crime he told someone about his great life and the great apartment in Zurich. He didn't mention that this was my apartment and that he lived in it with me. In hindsight, it feels like an attempted elimination assassination.

The Polish construction workers at the Basel Industrial Works (IWB) are being asked to cheat when recording working hours. According to the newspaper, workers are being asked to cheat when recording working hours. For example, on ten-hour days they are supposed to state that they have taken a two-hour break and still work on the days that are actually non-working without being stamped in. The employer even benefits from this in two ways: on the one hand, he can let the employees work twice as much, on the other hand, he only has to pay out the recorded hours. The bz cites both oral sources and documents intended to show "how Swiss labor law is undermined".
