Clever-Fit has introduced a new regulation to its fitness centers. The shutdown time is not credited to Clever-Fit customers on the current subscription, but only when they buy a new one or extend the existing one.

A refund is rarely offered in general: but most gyms offer an unconditional renewal of the subscription. For example the Activ Fitness. The validity of the subscriptions is extended by the duration of the effective closure. The studio decided to take this approach during the spring 2020 shutdown. Activ Fitness also offers regular live stream courses for its customers on Facebook. Clever-Fit also has a digital offer in partnership with the online platform Les Mills.

FC Basel and FC Winterthur will play in the Swiss Cup on Tuesday night. Davide Call√† talks about the match between the two teams. He says: The games were always hard-fought, emotional and often decided by controversial decisions. This time the VAR comes along and that's why scenes like this shouldn't happen again. We're also playing away from home for the first time against FCB. This is also a first for us alongside the VAR. What I can say: We believe in it, but we are also aware that a lot depends on how you are on the day. To be honest, one has to say that Thun was not in the form after the winter break and FC St. Gallen was not as strong as it was in the third and fourth quarters of the championship. We were in good spirits at the end of the season and would have liked to have continued playing, but then the break came.

My family and friends have known about it since 2016. Since then I've been walking around town with my (then) girlfriend, going to gay parties - I've never really been in the closet. Sexual orientation shouldn't be something you have to hide and then come out with anyway. After all, I've never heard of a hetero coming out.

It is not yet possible to estimate the long-term consequences of an infection with the novel corona virus. Researchers from the University Hospital Frankfurt are now giving an outlook on what recovered Covid 19 patients could expect. For the study, Puntmann and her colleagues evaluated the magnetic resonance images of the hearts of a total of 100 patients who had already recovered from infection with Sars-CoV-2 - either at home (2‚ÅÑ3) or in the hospital (1‚ÅÑ3). The recordings were made about two months after an acute corona infection.

Because of Corona, she was unable to go on three trips: "Peru last April, Madagascar in August and at the moment we would be through on our early honeymoon South America".

The Federal Council estimated the R value for December 4th at 1.13, which is an exponential growth. A week later, she corrected this down to 1.05 - and on December 28, the calculation of the R value for December 4 was exactly 1. The experts are convinced that the current R value does not reflect the real infection process and that the actual current number of reproductions is higher. The R value must then be corrected sharply when the number of reproductions is changing significantly, said Martin Ackermann, President of the Covid-19 Task Force, at the media conference on Tuesday.

The new Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse (CS) is the Portuguese Ant√≥nio Horta-Os√≥rio. He is called "The Special One" in the City of London like compatriot and football coach Jos√© Mourinho. Experts praise him for his digitization experience. He trimmed Lloyds to become Britain's most digital major bank with the highest spending on technology compared to the total costs, as the financial news portal "Finews" writes. Horta-Os√≥rio made headlines shortly after joining Lloyds in 2011. When he was one of the highest-paid bankers in the City of London and admitted to a special clinic for burnout, the tabloid media described him as the most expensive patient. Horta-Os√≥rio spoke widely about the disease, overcame it, and then steered Lloyds out of the red and back into profitability. Since then, he has worked to ensure that his employees are protected from psychological pressure, as the finance blog "Inside Paradeplatz" writes. Expert Lucatelli does not believe that the burnout could be negative for the new CS boss: "I have great respect when someone speaks openly about the fact that they suffered under the pressure of the 2008 financial crisis. That makes them more credible.". What also speaks for Horta-Os√≥rio: Experts praise him for his digitization experience.
Donald Trump says Pfizer was playing "corrupt games," because of Trump's intention to lower drug prices, which he had turned pharmaceutical companies against himself. According to Trump, the plan was actually for Pfizer to publish the data in October, i.e. before the election. "But they waited, waited and waited and then figured they would publish the results just a few days after the election." It probably would have affected the election if it had made Pfizer public earlier, Trump said.

Switzerland recorded significantly more deaths than expected during the corona pandemic. People over 65 were particularly affected by this excess mortality in the first and second corona waves (see graphic below). The Federal Statistical Office (FSO) writes: "Among the approximately 8,380 people aged 65 and older who died more than expected in the second wave, some were probably in such poor health that their lives were only shortened by a few weeks". In other words, some of the people who fell victim to Corona in the second wave would, as expected, have died one way or another a few weeks later. According to the Association of Cantonal Doctors, the protective and hygiene measures taken also play a role: "They have undoubtedly contributed to the current mortality rate. In Switzerland, the absence of the flu epidemic is likely to have reduced the number of deaths".
M.*, a service engineer, is caught by the police after he drove stoned. The road traffic office orders a precautionary withdrawal of ID. M. has to prove his roadworthiness in a traffic medical examination. He now has 40 days to find the 1,300 francs he has to pay before the examination. Because the institute where M. has to do the examination is quite busy, he won't be able to get an appointment for three months. Central to D√§hler: "Many people have lost their jobs because they didn't have their ID at times - and that's not uncommon, even though they were never guilty of anything on the road." That should change now: FDP Councilor of States Andrea Caroni wants to use a political initiative to speed up the procedure for a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license: According to the new regulation, M.* should have been informed within ten days whether a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license is ordered Or if he gets his driver's license back. M. could have contested this order in the first ten days and then every three months. Politically, the initiative seems undisputed: the Commission recommended it for acceptance without a dissenting vote, and the National Council and the Council of States also approved it.

Australian filmmakers are relocating to the country after the recent Covid-19 outbreak. Some of the biggest names are already in Australia, while others are relocating to the States. The Australian government has pumped the equivalent of around 290 million francs into its location incentive program, which is intended to attract international TV and film productions. For example, McCarthy and her husband, film producer Ben Falcone (47), received the equivalent of over nine million francs to shoot "God's Favorite Idiot" in Australia. "Filming our show safely in a beautiful country like Australia is a dream come true," the couple said in a statement. However, some Hollywood stars not only travel to Down Under for filming, they even emigrate. Australian-born Isla Fisher (45) and Nicole Kidman (53), for example, returned to their homeland with their families for a long time after several years in the States during the pandemic. And the American Zac Efron (33) also made Australia his new home at the end of last year.

Mike was a parasite. He stole from her and stole from her. Mike was sentenced to eleven years in prison and deported to Germany. Serena is now single and childless. Mike took all of that from her that night. "When I met Mike, I was working as a broker in Germany. The job was great, but I felt lonely. That's when Mike and I started chatting online. He was sweet, funny, intelligent - and incredibly bold. When he denied it, I believed him. I was young and stupid. Today I could slap myself for seeing him like that loved me very much.

Adela Civic, head of the family and social welfare department at the Social Affairs Office, says: "It is a targeted measure. These people should not get into a spiral of debt". Some people got into a difficult financial situation due to the corona pandemic, for example because they had lost their wages or their job. Before, they could have covered their living needs well, but not anymore.
According to a study in Sydney, more and more cockatoos have learned how to open garbage cans. From a survey of residents, ornithologist Richard Major in Australia and researchers in Germany found that in early 2018, cockatoos in three neighborhoods of Sydney were good at opening bins with their beaks, then moving along the bin rim far enough to do so the trash can lid tilts backwards. By the end of 2019, there were birds in 44 quarters.
Many Brits work from home. At the end of July, only a third of UK office workers were back on the job. Now there is growing concern among UK politicians and business groups that it will be a long time before workers are ready to return to the office. Because the consequences for the office centers with their caf√©s, pubs and retailers are significant, says the chief executive of the Confederation of British Industries.
The British Ministry of Health wants to discourage women from smoking during pregnancy. Specifically, the ministry would like to offer pregnant women shopping vouchers of up to ¬£400 if they stop smoking in return. A voucher is only given to those who have previously undergone a biochemical test and can thus prove that they do not smoke cigarettes. The Ministry of Health has high hopes for this: Studies would show that financial incentives are both effective and inexpensive to discourage pregnant women from smoking.
On the Witikonerstrasse in Zurich it looks like a ski slope without snow. The masts for the power lines of the VBZ buses and the lamppost are edged with orange shooters. In between there is a yellow barrier tape on orange poles. These measures were triggered by two fatal bicycle accidents that occurred at this point in 2020.
Prime Minister Markus S√∂der canceled a trip to the North Sea. He would have wanted to go on a mudflat hike with a colleague and would have gone to the seal banks, as German media reports unanimously. But nothing will come of the leisurely trip to the weekend. The reason: a massive breakdown in corona tests on Bavarian motorways. According to Melanie Huml, Bavaria's Minister of Health, there is a problem with the transmission of the results.
The eviction of an occupation in Bern has been overturned by a verdict by a single judge.

The Polish construction workers at the waste incineration plant of the Basel Industrial Works (IWB) are being asked to cheat when recording working hours. According to the newspaper, workers are being asked to cheat when recording working hours. The employer even benefits from this in two ways: on the one hand, he can let the employees work twice as much, on the other hand, he only has to pay out the recorded hours. The bz cites both oral sources and documents intended to show "how Swiss labor law is being undermined". The fitters, welders and locksmiths have been employed since the beginning of September as part of the annual inspection work. Due to various subcontractors involved, the responsibilities are difficult to assign, the newspaper writes.
The government has failed completely. Measures should have been taken much earlier. The locals took the initiative, says Valeria Ivic. "There are a lot of people there - from locals to expats," says the Swiss woman. "It's absolutely admirable how people get involved and organize!" Only when the locals became active and the interest of the international press increased did the government react and accept international help, among other things. The local people are dependent on tourism, so the atmosphere is very tense. Because in addition to the oil debacle, "Mauritius" borders are still closed - you only find out about an opening a few days in advance, says the Swiss.
