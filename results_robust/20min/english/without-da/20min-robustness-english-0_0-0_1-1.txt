Covid 19 patients are recovering from acute infection with the novel corona virus. However, heart damage was detected in a large proportion of the ex-Covid patients examined. The scientists fear that some of the heart damage could be permanent. This has already happened at the University Hospital Zurich: In April, Peter Steiger, Deputy Director of the Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, reported on a seriously ill Covid 19 patient who initially developed a heart attack and cardiac arrhythmia and finally died. Whether this was a sad exception or the rule remains to be seen, cardiologist Eberli is certain: "We don't yet know exactly what's going on."

On Tuesday, the Federal Council estimated the R value at 1.13, which is an exponential growth. A week later, she corrected this down to 1.05 - and on December 28, the calculation of the R value for December 4 was exactly 1. The experts are convinced that the current R value does not reflect the real infection process and that the actual current number of reproductions is higher. The R value must then be corrected sharply when the number of reproductions is changing significantly, said Martin Ackermann, President of the Covid 19 Task Force, at the media conference on Tuesday. This was the case on the days in question. According to Tanja Stadler, the estimate of the R value only ever indicates a trend as to how the number of infections developed around two weeks ago. The task force therefore does not focus on daily R values, but takes into account the 7-day average together with other indicators when assessing the situation.
The Jungfrau Railways are the first mountain railway in the world to use such a VIP concept. Anyone who spends 12,000 francs becomes a member of the Platinum Club and gets access to the lounge: instead of queuing at the valley station, members can eat and drink in the elegant ambience and bridge the time until the VIP gondola arrives.

Pfizer was playing "corrupt games," Donald Trump said at a press conference in the White House on Friday. The president believes the drug company deliberately waited until after the election to announce it had developed a vaccine. According to Trump, the plan was actually for Pfizer to publish the data in October, i.e. before the election. "But they waited, waited and waited and then figured they would publish the results just a few days after the election." It probably would have affected the election if it had made Pfizer public earlier, Trump said.

Reto M.*, a service engineer, was caught by the police after he smoked a joint. The road traffic department orders a precautionary withdrawal of his driver's license. M. has to prove his roadworthiness in a traffic medical examination. He has to undergo surgery and wear a device that measures his heart activity for a year and a half. Politically, the initiative seems undisputed: the Commission recommended it for acceptance without a dissenting vote, and the National Council and the Council of States also approved it. FDP Councilor of States Andrea Caroni wants to speed up the procedure for a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license: According to the new regulation, M.* should have been informed within ten days whether a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license is ordered Or if he gets his driver's license back. M. could have contested this order in the first ten days and then every three months. Politically, the initiative seems undisputed: the Commission recommended it for acceptance without a dissenting vote, and the National Council and the Council of States also approved it. Caroni says he had previously clarified this with the Federal Roads Office. The Roadcross organization, on the other hand, has concerns: "We are definitely in favor of people who are affected by a driver's license withdrawal being given a fair process and having the opportunity to defend themselves," says media spokesman Mike Egle. What must not happen, however, is that people whose driver's license is revoked are given a "loophole": "It must be ensured that people whose license is revoked are not on the road again before the final decision is made." The Roadcross organization, on the other hand, has concerns: "We are definitely in favor of people who are affected by a driver's license withdrawal being given a fair process and having the opportunity to defend themselves," says media spokesman Mike Egle.

Central to D√§hler: "Many people have lost their jobs because they didn't have their ID at times - and that's not uncommon, even though they were never guilty of anything on the road." That should change now: FDP Councilor of States Andrea Caroni wants to speed up the procedure for a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license: According to the new regulation, M.* should have been informed within ten days whether a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license is ordered Or if he gets his driver's license back.
