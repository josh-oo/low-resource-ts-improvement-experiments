FC Basel and FC Winterthur will play in the Swiss Cup this Tuesday night. The match will be a first for FCB alongside the VAR. Davide Call√†: The games were always hard-fought, emotional and often decided by controversial decisions. This time the VAR comes along and that's why scenes like this shouldn't happen again. We believe in it, but we are also aware that a lot depends on how you are on the day.

We were in good spirits at the end of the season and would have liked to have continued playing, but then the break came.

Noelia, you're a lesbian. Last week you did an Insta Q&A and asked "How are the guys?" relatively surprisingly answered with "I'm gay". Why did you decide to answer the question at all? I could have ignored this question, because about 300 came in. But many revolved around the topic of love and men. Even though I hardly ever post anything private on my channel, this time I thought: why not? Was that something like an outing? Not for me personally. My family and friends have known about it since 2016. Since then I've been walking around town with my (then) girlfriend, going to gay parties - I've never really been in the closet. Sexual orientation shouldn't be something you have to hide and then come out with anyway. After all, I've never heard of a hetero coming out.

But the attempt has nothing to do with the virus.

Rapper Cardi B (28) tweeted about Peppa Pig on Twitter. Because Cardi's daughter Kulture (2) is so obsessed with the British cartoon character that she currently wants to jump into every puddle of rain like her big role model. "This shit gets on my nerves! She breaks her Uggs," Cardi wrote on Twitter. "Peppa Pig" is a British animated children's series that has achieved cult status around the world. In the probably not very serious tweet, Cardi even threatens the cartoon character: "Count your damn days!" The fact that Kulture now has a "Peppa Pig" ban cannot be ruled out, but it would be pretty nasty. Maybe Cardi Kulture shouldn't wear the most expensive Ugg boots anymore?

The conservative Republicans have been fighting against tightening of the law for years.

The Covid-19 Task Force estimated the R value at 1.13, which is an exponential growth. A week later, she corrected this down to 1.05 - and on December 28, the calculation of the R value for December 4 was exactly 1. The experts are convinced that the current R value does not reflect the real infection process and that the actual current number of reproductions is higher. The estimate of the R value only ever indicates a trend as to how the number of infections developed around two weeks ago. The task force therefore does not focus on daily R values, but takes into account the 7-day average together with other indicators when assessing the situation.

Finance Minister Ueli Maurer is against using the National Bank. "There is no reason to claim additional funds from the National Bank. It has another task that is currently underestimated.

The National Bank should not be allowed to pay the state's debts.

Donald Trump believes Pfizer deliberately waited until after the election to announce it had developed a vaccine. According to Trump, the plan was actually for Pfizer to publish the data in October, i.e. before the election. "But they waited, waited and waited and then figured they would publish the results just a few days after the election." It probably would have affected the election if it had made Pfizer public earlier, Trump said.

In September, US top model Gigi Hadid (25) became a mother for the first time and has since largely withdrawn from social media. Now she's back with new Insta image feed - and for the first time shows several excerpts from her new life as a mom. That was the good news. The bad: Gigi doesn't reveal much in the new photos either. It is true that she presents her little daughter to us in the baby carrier for the first time. But we don't get to see more than the back of their heads and a handful of dark hairs.

M.*, a service engineer, drove a car every day. Although he never drove stoned, the office orders a precautionary withdrawal of a driver's license. M. has to prove his roadworthiness in a traffic medical examination. He now has 40 days to find the 1,300 francs he has to pay before the examination. Because the institute where he has to do the examination is quite busy, he won't be able to get an appointment for three months. Politically, the initiative seems undisputed: the Commission recommended it for acceptance without a dissenting vote, and the National Council and the Council of States also approved it.

When the playoff final between Geneva-Servette and EV Zug starts on Monday, the era of the "Big 4" will end for the time being. For the first time since 1998, the ZSC Lions, SC Bern, HC Davos and HC Lugano do not become Swiss champions. These four clubs had shared the league titles for the past 22 years. The last triumph before this period of more than two decades was won by one of this year's two finalists, namely the EVZ. For Geneva, on the other hand, the championship title would be a premiere. But who has the advantage in the final? At first glance, the central Swiss seem to be the clear favourites.
Australia is a hotspot for Hollywood stars. It's where the biggest names of the world are filming.

For example, Melissa McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone (47), received the equivalent of over nine million francs to shoot "God's Favorite Idiot" in Australia. However, some Hollywood stars not only travel to Down Under for filming, they even emigrate. Australian-born Isla Fisher (45) and Nicole Kidman (53), for example, returned to their homeland with their families for a long time after several years in the States during the pandemic. And the American Zac Efron (33) also made Australia his new home at the end of last year.

The canton of St. Gallen is providing financial support for people who are no longer able to cover their expenses due to the corona crisis and despite comprehensive federal and cantonal aid programs. Adela Civic, head of the family and social welfare department at the Social Affairs Office, says: "It is a targeted measure. These people should not get into a spiral of debt".

The Ministry of Health has high hopes for this: Studies would show that financial incentives are both effective and inexpensive to discourage pregnant women from smoking.

The Polish workers at the Basel Industrial Works are being asked to cheat when recording working hours. According to the newspaper, workers are being asked to cheat when recording working hours. For example, on ten-hour days they are supposed to state that they have taken a two-hour break and still work on the days that are actually non-working without being stamped in. The employer even benefits from this in two ways: on the one hand, he can let the employees work twice as much, on the other hand, he only has to pay out the recorded hours. The bz cites both oral sources and documents intended to show "how Swiss labor law is being undermined".

The first to get involved were the locals: "When oil ran into the sea, the locals took the initiative," says Valeria Ivic (22).

But we've also found feces in our changing rooms. It sucks - literally". "You can learn so many new things if you are open and talk to customers. You learn incredibly interesting things, especially from older people. That's worth its weight in gold".
Switzerland has been negotiating a framework agreement with Brussels for a long time. The goal of the negotiations: the continuation of the bilateral path, i.e. the special agreement between Switzerland and the EU.

Previously, changes had to be renegotiated each time.

(name changed) lived in Germany for professional reasons and had his first name and official gender entry deleted at the registry office. Last June, P. in Switzerland applied to his hometown in the canton of Aargau for the change of first name and deletion of the gender entry in the Swiss register to be accepted. However, the responsible department rejected the request to delete the gender entry. P. then lodged a complaint with the Aargau High Court with the support of the "Transgender Network Switzerland" (TGNS).

In the "Tages-Anzeiger" (Payment Items) tests, the network quality in the stores of major retailers is poor. The problem is that phone calls are only possible via services such as Whatsapp or Signal. In addition, communication via public networks is potentially insecure. According to the report, a separate radio cell for a branch can quickly cost tens of thousands of francs. Lidl seems to be more consistent here: According to spokesman Mathias Kaufmann, the company has made improvements in the branches where poor cell phone reception was measured and installed repeaters or its own radio cells. The explanation for the poor reception is more likely to be found in the fact that efficient solutions such as the use of repeaters, i.e. amplifiers for the existing radio signal from outside, are significantly more expensive than your own WLAN. According to information from Migros and Coop, such are installed in some branches, but as the test shows, the problem of poor network reception persists in many shops. Lidl seems to be more consistent here: According to spokesman Mathias Kaufmann, the company has made improvements in the branches where poor cell phone reception was measured and installed repeaters or its own radio cells.
