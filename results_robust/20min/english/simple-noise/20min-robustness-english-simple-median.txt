The question of where she came from has taken up more and more space in her life. GC is aware that it will be difficult, almost impossible, to find out about their origins.

For example, I would be very interested to know what my father looks like, what he works for or what nationality he is." She knows that it's basically almost impossible for her to ever meet her biological father. "It hurts that I don't know where i come from I try to accept it. But a part of me will always be missing."
In Switzerland, domestic helpers receive an average of 30 francs per hour gross wage for their work. However, most of them receive 28 francs. After deducting the contributions for the obligatory accident insurance and social insurance, the household help still has an average of 25 francs per hour, as reported by the company Quitt.ch, which specializes in payroll accounting for household help. The analysis of more than 4000 employment contracts, which, according to Quitt.ch, is also used by the Federal Statistical Office, reveals significant wage differences depending on the canton.

Clever-Fit has published a regulation on social media. Customers can't extend their subscriptions during a shutdown. Clever-Fit's managing director Thomas Ramsauer says to 20 Minuten that they believe they have "found a balance between goodwill towards customers and economically conscientious action".

A refund is rarely offered in general: but most gyms offer an unconditional renewal of the subscription. For example the Activ Fitness. The validity of the subscriptions is extended by the duration of the effective closure. The studio decided to take this approach during the spring 2020 shutdown. Activ Fitness also offers regular live stream courses for its customers on Facebook. Clever-Fit also has a digital offer in partnership with the online platform Les Mills.

After the court hearing, I found out that on the day of the crime he told someone about his great life and the great apartment in Zurich. He didn't mention that this was my apartment and that he lived in it with me.
